# svelte-kit-demo

Place to try out [@sveltejs/app](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit). Very basic and incomplete, many things haven't yet been thought through.

To start the app in development mode do `npm run dev`. To build, use `npm run build`. This will use whichever adapter is specified in `svelte.config.cjs`, which will also need to be installed (or linked).
